## Introduction

Keep your mind on track! Don't waste time creating fancy tables.

A plugin designed to view and edit `CSV files` directly within Obsidian.

I have a plan to design my own database using json and csv only. If you have fancy idea about tables or csv, please feel free to issue (I will consider it in my new plugin) or search it in community. For in-markdown edit, I recommend `anyblock` with a much more complex syntax.

## Why another csv plugin?

There are so many csv plugin, why you need this one?

Because I want to keep it **simple and stupid**. 

And keep up with the **newest obsidian api and typings**.

No fancy feature, just open and edit.

## Philosophy

- No fancy UI, SAY NO TO
    - modals
	- sidebar
	- settingTab
	- Readme
	- Online docs & tutorials
    - All functions of the ui components above will be covered in a single File view.
- All in TextFileView/workspace.
- No more pollution to your vault, all metadata store in `./.obsidian/plugins/csv` in json format.
- Every function must be completed within 3 steps:
    0. Locate it visually
	1. Click/Hotkey
	2. Input (if needed)
	3. Confirm/Leave
- The interface should remain minimal yet functional
- Users shouldn't need to leave their workflow environment
- CSV manipulation should be as natural as text editing.

## Features

- View CSV files in table format
- Edit CSV files within Obsidian
- Supports standard CSV formatting
- Compatible with Obsidian's interface

## Purpose

This plugin enhances Obsidian's functionality by allowing users to work with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files seamlessly within their vault, eliminating the need to switch between different applications for CSV handling.

## Getting Started

Install the plugin through Obsidian's community plugins section and start viewing your CSV files directly in your notes.
